# NetDevops
Using Ansible as a SDN controller to automate several pieces of a modern data center network in a leaf spine configuration.  This demonstration was used at All Things Open talk "Using Devops Tools For Modern Data Centers" by Sean Cavanaugh on October 19, 2015.  

##Topology
Here is the topology for the demonstration:

##Playbook descriptions
- playbook.yml - this playbook is used to provision the network with [OSPF Unnumbered](http://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/CL25/Open+Shortest+Path+First+-+OSPF+-+Protocol).  Each node is given a single IP address instead of burning (using up) an IP address per link.
- playbook-fan.yml - this playbook runs when spine2 (4.4.4.4) has been identified to have a bad fan
- playbook-check.yml - this playbook runs to check that spine2 (4.4.4.4) has been removed from the routing table gracefully

all other playbooks are just for provisioning part of the network, or are just tests sean is playing with while he makes this demo better and better
